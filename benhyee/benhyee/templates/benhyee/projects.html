		WhichWay is the first application that uses pace and compass calibration to track user position without the use of GPS or Data Service - or any external connection at all for that matter. The application uses the accelerometer to detect user movement and the compass for direction. The user inputs initial calibration settings, and then the application tracks their movement from thereon.  WhichWay also uses downloadable maps and floorplans as templates on which it will track the userâ€™s path and serve as a map. <br>

	As part of the UROV team, I worked on the Electrical Team. I spent countless (but memorable) hours testing the thrusters, soldering male-female connectors for the waterproof housing, wiring the motors to the motor shield through the arduino mega pins, stringing epoxy foam balls for the tether, and working on camera functionality. Overall, robotics has given me the most experience in the field of Electrical Engineering out of all my projects. For more information on our UROV as a whole:

			Industrial Manufacturing Engineering had us create our very own Power Supplies from scratch! We began our project learning how to use Diptrace, a CAD software specifically used for PCB design and manufacturing. Through the labs, we were introduced to the manufacturing process of PCB boards from designing the circuitry; to the etch, develop and stripping process. After creating a PCB, we began learning the different techniques of electronic assembly: soldering, crimping, heat shrinking, and troubleshooting. Through the lectures, we learned different manufacturing techniques for PCB's and how IC's were created.

		<h1 class = "bigletters"> QuadCopter </h1>
		<br>
		<p1 align = "left">
			This project was a summer project of 2015. Starting with a QAV 250, I learned about the necessary components of the Quadcopter. This is the first project working with ESC (Electronic Speed Controllers) and radio transmitters/receivers. Working on the Quadcopter including alot of soldering bullet connectors to the ESC and Brushless Motors. The Quadcopter utilized a Power Distribution board to distribute power to all 4 motors equally. This was all controlled through a transmitter wired to a CC3D flight controller which was in charge of balancing the motors so that the Quadcopter can be level. Overall, I was introduced to radio controllers since I had to bind the transmitter and receiver, and how to break down a project into seperate tasks.
